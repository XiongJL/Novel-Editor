# Novel Editor User Guide

## 1. Interface Overview
Use the left Activity Bar to switch major views:
- Explorer: volume/chapter management
- Ideas: idea capture and browsing
- Plot: plot lines and plot points
- World: characters/items/world settings/maps
- Search: global search
- AI Workbench: AI draft generation with confirm-to-save flow
- Settings: theme, language, and AI configuration

## 2. Basic Writing Operations
- New volume/chapter: click `+` in Explorer
- Rename: double-click a volume or chapter name
- Open chapter: single-click a chapter
- Auto-save: chapter content is saved automatically while editing
- Formatting: toolbar supports style, alignment, font size, and auto-format

## 3. AI Features

### 3.1 Title Generation
1. Click "Generate Title with AI" near the chapter title.
2. The system proposes candidate titles from current chapter context.
3. Click a candidate to replace the title.

Note: a full staged progress bar for title generation is planned next; current build provides basic loading feedback.

### 3.2 Continue Writing (Recommended Flow)
1. Click "Continue Writing" to open the config modal.
2. Set target length, creativity level, context chapter range, and style/tone.
3. Optionally select one or more idea references.
4. Review generated preview first, then confirm insertion.

Chapter-1 rule: if no outline exists for chapter one, the app guides you to create an outline or write a manual opening first.

### 3.3 AI Workbench
1. Open "AI Workbench" from Activity Bar.
2. Enter your brief (genre, style, conflict, etc.).
3. Generate drafts (outline, characters, items, skills, maps).
4. Edit/delete/select entries in the draft list.
5. Confirm persistence.

Note: validation runs before persistence. If one item fails, the batch is rolled back atomically.

### 3.4 Summary Strategy
- Local summary: fast, no model token cost.
- AI summary: higher quality, consumes model tokens.
- Recommended: use AI summary in manual mode or when a chapter is finished.
